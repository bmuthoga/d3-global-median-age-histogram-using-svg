# Global Median Age Histogram
This is a simple D3.JS histogram displaying the global median age of a specific year, built with `D3.JS` and `SVGs`

The `input slider` can be used to adjust the `number of histogram bins/bickets`

The data used has been sourced and compiled from [UN data](https://data.un.org/)

The app, and online editor, can also be found here on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/d3-global-median-age-histogram-using-svg-33tno)

Below is a preview of how it looks like:
